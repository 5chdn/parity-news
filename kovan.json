        "markdown": "[Kovan](https://github.com/kovan-testnet/proposal) is a new community driven test network that runs on the Parity Aura Proof Of Authority consensus engine.\n\nWith a consistent 4 second blocktime, immunity to proof of work spam attacks, the network allows developers to develop their applications on a reliable platform. While in an early phase, it already has proven itself to be consistent and available, with all the tools you have come to expect from a testnet ecosystem.\n\nTo learn more, ready the original [press release](http://www.ibtimes.co.uk/parity-pushes-new-ethereum-testnet-kovan-after-spam-attacks-1609901) or join us on [gitter](https://gitter.im/kovan-testnet/Lobby)."
